# C34313Models
Models for the simulation exercises in course 34313.

The repository will contain:
- bootsync.sh -- Script to download the model files to the /home/sim/ModelArchive directory. Note that the most recent version of this script will be downloaded and executed at each restart of the VM (see /usr/local/sbin/bootsync0.sh)
- ModelsPart{1-3}.zip -- Archive with files for the individual parts of the exercise. Note that the relevant zip-files will only be available shortly before the relevant part of the exercise.
